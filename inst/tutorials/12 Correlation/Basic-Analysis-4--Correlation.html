<div id="section-mhc-promiscuity-and-pathogen-diversity" class="section level2">
<h2>MHC promiscuity and pathogen diversity</h2>
<p>The major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a region of the vertebrate genome encoding cell-surface proteins that are important in the recognition of foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses by the immune system. Within humans, there is considerable genetic diversity in the alleles that encode for the MHC. One possible explanation for this is that t is driven by host-pathogen interactions, and one aspect of this that could be important is the variety of antigens which a particular MHC allele can bind to, with more “promiscuous” alleles being able to promote immune activity against a broader range of pathogens and so being more generalist. If these generalist alleles are favoured in regions of high pathogen diversity this could explain some of the geographical variation that is known to exist in MHC alleles. Máté Manczinger and co-workers tested this idea in a paper published in 2019<sup>1</sup>. They collected allele prevalence data for the HLA-DRB1 MHC gene from a number of populations worldwide and used two methods to estimate the promiscuity for the gene for each population: firstly, they used bioinformatics techniques to predict the binding affinities for the alleles in question, and secondly they used empirical data on MHC binding <em>in vitro,</em> giving two separate measures. For each population they were then able to calculate the pathogen richness in the corresponding geographical area using publicly available data on the prevalence 168 extracellular pathogens (bacteria, fungi, protists and helminths). They also calculated similar data for intracellular pathogens such as viruses.</p>
<p>We’ll look at one of their two response variables the <em>in-vitro</em> promiscuity levels for the HLA-DRB1 gene, an estimate of how broad the antigen binding capabilities are at a population level. There are two explanatory variables, extracellular pathogen diversity and intracelullar pathogen diversity. Since intracellular pathogens are not exposed to the aspects of the immune response associated with the MHC, the prediction to be tested is that HLA-DRB1 promiscuity should correlate with extracellular but not intracellular pathogen diversity.</p>
<p>The data are loaded as a dataframe called <code>mhc</code>. As always, we need to check our data have loaded properly. Use <code>str()</code> to check the structure of the dataset.</p>

<p>All looks fine. <code>Intracellular</code> and <code>Extracellular</code> are the two pathogen diversity estimates. <code>Promiscuity_pred</code> is the predicted promiscuity from the bioinformatics study and <code>Promiscuity_in_vivo</code> is the promiscuity based on empirical lab tests. The units for promiscuity are abitrary because the values have been normalised, the units for pathogen diversity are in numbers of species. Some of the latter are fractional because of the way these were estimated.</p>
<p>We’re focussing on the <em>in-vitro</em> promiscuity, and whether this correlates with the extracellular and intracellular pathogen diversities. As always, we’ll start by drawing a graph and looking at the data. In this case, with two variables which are both continuous data, scatterplots are appropriate.

<p>Looking at this plot it’s much harder to see any relationship between the two variables. In both the intra- and extracellular cases, however, the data are fairly noisy and it would be helpful to to firstly quantify how strong the relationship between the two variables is and secondly to ask how likely such a pattern would be to arise simply by sampling error.</p>

<div id="section-calculating-the-correlation-coefficient" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculating the correlation coefficient</h2>
<p>In this section we’ll just consider the relationship between <em>in-vitro</em> promiscuity and extracellular pathogens. Let’s start by calculating <em>r</em>, the correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>The formula for <em>r</em> is somewhat intimidating:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r = \left. \frac{\Sigma{\left(x-\bar{x}\right) \left(y-\bar{y}\right)}}{n-1} \right/s_xs_y,
\]</span></p>
<p>but it can be broken down into more easily understood parts.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Sigma{\left(x-\bar{x}\right) \left(y-\bar{y}\right)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Is the sum of the differences between the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> values and their respective means. If there is a positive correlation this will give a positive value and if a negative correlation it will give a negative value. This number is dependent on the sample size, however, with larger samples giving larger values for the same sort of relationship just because there is more data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Sigma{\left(x-\bar{x}\right) \left(y-\bar{y}\right)}}{n-1} 
\]</span></p>
<p>Is this value divided by the <em>degrees of freedom</em> (<span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>) which corrects for sample size. This value is called the <em>covariance</em>, but it’s still not particularly useful here because it will vary depending on the scale that our data are measured on: if one of our variables was human height measured in mm, for example, we would get a larger value for the covariance than if it were human height measured in m.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r = \left. \frac{\Sigma{\left(x-\bar{x}\right) \left(y-\bar{y}\right)}}{n-1} \right/s_xs_y,
\]</span></p>
<p>is the covariance <em>standardised</em> by the product of the standard deviations of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and $y$. This takes out the effect of scale, and gives us a value for the correlation coefficient (technically in this case <em>Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient</em> but life’s too short for names that long) that will always be between -1 and 1, with -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicating no correlation and +1 indicating a perfect positive correlation. Let’s calculate <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> for our data. See if you can fill in the bits marked with XXXXX.</p>

<p>Hopefully you’ve got a value of 0.674. This is about what we’d expect given what we can see in the plot: a medium-strength positive correlation. What about testing this for significance?</p>
</div>
<div id="section-testing-r-for-significance" class="section level2">
<h2>Testing <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> for significance</h2>
<p>You hopefully recall that when we calculate a <em>sample mean</em> <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> we are producing an estimate of the <em>population mean</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. In just the same way, the value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> that we’ve calculated is the <em>sample correlation coefficient</em> and is an estimate of the <em>population correlation coefficient</em> <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. The null hypothesis that we want to test in this case is that <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> = 0. In other words, if the overall, population-level pattern was that there were no correlation, we want to know the probability of seeing a sample correlation coefficient as big as we did (or one even more extreme).</p>
<p>When we were doing t-tests to compare two sample means, we calculated the <em>effect</em> which was the difference between means, and we standardised it by dividing our value by a figure that meant that if the null hypothesis were true we would expect it to be distributed on a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution. Having done that we could ask how likely we would be to see the value that we observed if the null hypothesis of no difference were true. We can do the same with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and in fact we can calculate a value based on <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> that we would expect to follow a t-distribution if the null hypothesis were true. This is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
t = \frac{r \sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}, 
\]</span></p>
<p>and if the null hypothesis were true we would expect it to be distributed on a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span> degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>We know that r = 0.674 and n = 28, so try to calculate t.</p>

<div id="section-using-rs-built-in-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Using R’s built-in function</h2>
<p>Of course, R has a built in function to do this analysis, namely <code>cor.test()</code>. All you have to do is to give it the names of the two variables in question as arguments and it’ll do the rest. NB because we’re not implying any direction of effect in a correlation analysis — the analysis does not make the assumption that promiscuity is caused by diversity or vice-versa — we don’t enter the variables to be analysed as a formula with a tilde <code>~</code>, just as two arguments separated by commas.</p>

<h2>Assumptions of correlation analysis and Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient</h2>
<p>As with all parametric analyses, the correlation analysis we’ve used depends on the data being analysed having certain properties. These <em>assumptions</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data should be approximately normally distributed. Ideally, both of the variables being analysed should be normally distributed, so symmetrical and with the majority of the data close to the mean. In practice, this analysis is not affected by small deviations from normality in the data being analysed, especially when sample sizes are large. If there is obvious skew in one or both variables, however, or if there is some other substantial deviation from normality then you should think about whether this might be impacting your analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Data should be continuously distributed. This sort of analysis works best when your data can take any value. If the data are categorial or otherwise constrained to only have a few values (Satisfied/neutral/dissatisfied or alive/dead or similar) then you shouldn’t using this sort of analysis. Integer data (e.g. counts of things) are OK so long as there’s a decent range: so if your data go from 12 to 127 with lots of different values that’s fine, but if you only have 0, 1 &amp; 2 then probably not.</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between the two variables should be approximately linear: in other words it should be roughly a straight line rather than a curve.</p></li>
<li><p>A further “assumption” that you’ll often see listed is that there should be no major outliers. This is a bit of a tricky one: anomalous data points will influence the output of the analysis, but of course we have to be very careful in designating data points “outliers” when they will often be legitimate observations that just happen to have rather extreme values. Rather than listing this as an “assumption” it’s probbaly better to just say that you should be aware that major outliers will have a big effect on your results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If these assumptions are violated in a significant way then there are a number of options available. If the data are positively skewed or the relationship has some types of non-linearity then you might be able to apply some sort of transformation (a log transformation or a square root transformation will often deal with skewed data). Otherwise one popular option is to use a non-parametric equivalent of the Pearson’s correlation analysis, such as <em>Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient</em>. This is a quite simple variation of the parametric analysis: instead of analysing the values themselves, both variables are ranked from the smallest to the largest and a correlation coefficient is computed using the ranks. If you had a dataset like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(2112)

dat1 &lt;- data.frame(matrix(data = round(rnorm(10, 10, 6),1), nrow = 5))
names(dat1) &lt;- c(&quot;X1&quot;, &quot;Y1&quot;)

print(dat1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>    X1   Y1
1 15.5 13.8
2  8.2 16.4
3  6.2 15.3
4  6.3 13.7
5 13.5 17.8</code></pre>
<p>You can extract the rankings for a variable with the <code>rank()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rank(dat1$X1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 5 3 1 2 4</code></pre>
<p>So for the first variable the lowest value is the third one, 6.2, so this has rank 1, the second lowest is 6.3 which has rank 2 and so on until we reach the highest value, 15.5, which has rank 5.</p>
<p>To calculate r<sub>s</sub>, the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, we can just plug these ranked data into an ordinary correlation analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor.test(rank(dat1$X1), rank(dat1$Y1))</code></pre>
<pre><code>
    Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation

data:  rank(dat1$X1) and rank(dat1$Y1)
t = 0.35355, df = 3, p-value = 0.7471
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.828449  0.919940
sample estimates:
cor 
0.2 </code></pre>
<p>or we can add the argument <code>method = "spearman"</code> without ranking the variables ourselves. We’re also adding a further argument which we wouldn’t normally use, <code>exact = FALSE</code> to make R calculate the p-value in the same way as for an ‘ordinary’ correlation: otherwise it’s calculated using a different method for this analysis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor.test(dat1$X1, dat1$Y1, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, exact = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>
    Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho

data:  dat1$X1 and dat1$Y1
S = 16, p-value = 0.7471
alternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0
sample estimates:
rho 
0.2 </code></pre>
<p>The values for r<sub>s</sub> and the p-value we get are exactly the same for both methods so you can see how the Spearman’s analysis relates to the Pearson’s.</p>
<p>If you read the paper by Manczinger et al. which we used for the data we’ve analysed here you’ll see that they used the non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation analysis rather than the Pearson’s for their data. Let’s have another look and think about why that might be. Here are the two scatterplots again.</p>
<p><img src="Basic-Analysis-4--Correlation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>What might be causing the original authors concern? Have a look at the plots and see what you think.</p>

<p>The main aspect of these data that might be causing a problem is possible non-linearity in the plot of MHC promiscuity versus Extracellular pathogen diversity — for low diversities, it seems that there is more of a flat relationship, which then becomes steeper at higher diversities. We can visualise this better by adding a <em>non-parametric smoother</em> to these data. Briefly, this is a technique which gives an indication of the trends in the data according to the data which are near a particular point rather than on the basis of the whole dataset, so it can show you changes in slope.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(Promiscuity_in_vitro ~ Extracellular,
     data = mhc,
     pch = 16,
     col = &quot;aquamarine4&quot;,
     xlab = &quot;Extracellular pathogen diversity (species)&quot;,
     ylab = &quot;Population-level promiscuity&quot;)

lines(lowess(x = mhc$Extracellular, y = mhc$Promiscuity_in_vitro))</code></pre>
<p><img src="Basic-Analysis-4--Correlation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>You can see this better now. Is this a big enough and obvious enough departure from linearity to invalidate the correlation analysis? Maybe… one thing that we should mention is that this pattern was even stronger in the predicted MHC promiscuity data from the bioinformatics analysis, which we’ve not analysed here.</p>
<p>Let’s finish up by carrying out a Spearman’s analysis on MHC promiscuity as related to both intracellular and extracellular pathogen diversity.</p>

R gives us a warning message because some of the ranks are tied, but this isn’t really anything to worry about. You can see that (unsurprisingly) our main conclusions are not affected: there remains a good correlation between population-level MHC promiscuity and extracellular pathogen diversity which is signfiicant at a very low p-value. The relationship between population-level MHC promiscuity and intracellular pathogen diversity is weak at best and certainly not statistically significant.
