<h2>Models combining factors and continuous explanatory variables</h2>
<p>You should now be starting to feel familiar with fitting linear models with multiple explanatory variables. Up to this point, however, we’ve focussed on either multiple factors (tutorial 4) or multiple continuous variables (tutorial 5). The next step, of course, is to fit models with both factors and continuous variables. People often find these difficult to interpret, but the trick is to remember that a model with a factor and a continuous explanatory variable is essentially fitting a series of lines, one for each factor level, with the slope being determined by the relationship between the continuous variable and the response variable. If there is no interaction then the lines will all share a common slope, with the differences in intercept being determined by the factor levels. An interaction term in a model with a factor and a continuous variable means that the lines are fitted with a different slope for each level of the factor.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exercise-1-pinniped-brains-and-mating-systems" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 1: pinniped brains and mating systems</h2>
<p>Let’s start with an fairly straightforward example. This comes from a study of brain size and mating type in pinnipeds (seals, sealions and walruses) published in 2012 by John Fitzpatrick and coauthors<sup>1</sup>. As part of a study of how mating system might impact on the evolution of brain and body size, Fitzpatrick <em>et al.</em> collected data on brain and body size and mating system for males and females from 33 species of pinniped. The data are loaded as a dataframe called <code>pinniped</code>, and you should start by checking it with the <code>str()</code> function.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="pinniped_import" data-caption="Code" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

</div>
<p>We’re interested here in the relationship between body mass and brain mass for males, and how it relates to the intensity of sexual selection each species experiences. The latter is indicated here by a variable called <code>Mate_type</code> which has two values. <code>mono</code> indicates species where the males are <em>monogynous</em>, pairing with a single female at a time, whereas <code>poly</code> indicates species with <em>polygynous</em> males which defend groups of females against rival males during the breeding season. Polygynous males are expected to experience stronger sexual selection during the breeding season.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Before going any further we should do some exploratory analysis. In this case a scatterplot of <code>Male_brain_g</code> versus <code>Male_mass_Kg</code> would be appropriate, and you can colour-code it for <code>Mate_type</code> by firstly declaring <code>Mate_type</code> to be a factor and then specifying <code>col = Mate_type</code> as an argument in your <code>plot()</code> function call. Since we’re just doing some exploratory analysis we won’t worry about a legend — because <code>poly</code> comes after <code>mono</code> in the alphabet the <code>poly</code> data will be coded red and the <code>mono</code> data black. Don’t forget to label the axes appropriately.</p>

<p>The log transformation seems to have sorted out the problems associated with the very skewed data. Now to fit a model. We’d like the main effects of both <code>Male_mass_Kg</code> and <code>Mate_type</code>, plus their interaction. Don’t forget to log both of the variables that require transformation, and call your fitted model object <code>P1</code>.</p>
<p>Once the model is fitted, check the significance of the interaction term using <code>drop1()</code>. Note that to get the equivalent output to normal you’ll need to use `print(drop1(… )) because otherwise the formatting applied in the tutorial will alter it.</p>

<p>The diagnostic plots do not iondicate anything particularly concerning. The qq-plot shows no serious deviation from what would be expected if the residuals were normally distributed. The residuals versus fitted values plot shows some hint of increasing variance with higher fitted values but this is not clear. When sample sizes are relatively small it becomes more difficult to see real patterns on diagnostic plots. Furthermore, when sample sizes are small we quite often see patterns that are more a consequence of the chance distribution of a few large positive or negative residuals than representative of a real issue with the data. Given the uncertainty about whether there really is heteroskedasticity, and the general robustness of the linear model, we will leave it as it is.</p>

<p>Since we have a model with one continuous explanatory variable and one factor with two levels, and we have an interaction term in our model, we are fitting a model that consists of two lines with different slopes as well as different intercepts. On the basis of the explanation given in the video, try to work out that the equations for the two lines relating log male mass to log brain mass are. Just as a reminder the two factor levels in <code>Mate_type</code> are <code>mono</code> and <code>poly</code> and <code>mono</code> comes first alphabetically.</p>

<h2>Visualising the fitted model using <code>predict()</code>.</h2>
<p>We could visualise the data by plotting the data with the two lines derived from the coefficients table, either using <code>abline()</code> or using a custom function like the <code>goodline()</code> function that was referred to in the video to keep the lines within the data they are fitted to. This will give an acceptable graph, but it won’t give any indication of the amount of uncertainty around each line. To do this we can use a function called <code>predict()</code> which will allow us to generate fitted values and either confidence intervals or prediction intervals for a range of data.</p>
<p>To use predict we need to set up a dummay data frame with the values that we’d like to generate fitted values and (in this case) confidence intervals for. The first thing we’ll need to know is the range of values for <code>Male_mass_Kg</code> for the two levels of <code>Mate_type</code>.

<h3>Final point: independence of data</h3>
<p>As we’ve discussed in earlier tutorials, independence of data is a fundamental assumption behind this sort of analysis and also something that you can’t really check: rather you have to think a out it when designing your study. Are the data points in this study independent? No — because some of the species are more cloesly related to some of the other species, and so these are likely to be more similar than we’d expect by chance even in the absence of any effect of mating system. As an example of this take a look at the species in this dataset with male body masses of less than 100Kg.</p>

<p>Six of these are from the genus <em>Phoca</em>, and all of these have monogynous males. What’s more, these are all the species from the genus <em>Phoca</em> on the dataset. There’s an obvious capacity here for apparent patterns in the dataset to be driven by evolutionary history rather than other factors. It could simply be the case that the common ancestor of the genus <em>Phoca</em> was small and monogynous, and that any apparent tendency for smaller males to be monogynous is a consequence of that rather than any evolutionary tendency towards small size in monogynous species. This is not something that we can correct for in this analysis here, but there are techniques for correcting for phylogenetic non-independence such as Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares or PGLS. Yhis is what Fitzpatrick et al. used in their paper: I’m pleased to say that the fundamental conclusions were unchanged.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Insulin-like peptides and beetle weaponry</h2>
<p>In many species of animal one sex (usually the male, but not always) carries weapons such as horns, enlarged mandibles or similar which are used in contests with other animals from the same species. These weapons are often extremely variable in size between individuals, and an interesting question is why this should be and how the growth of these weapons is regulated. In 2019 a team of scientists based in Japan and the USA<sup>2</sup> published the results of an in-depth study on the regulation of weapon size in a beetle called the broad-horned flour beetle, <em>Gnatocerus cornutus</em>. Males of this species have enlarged mandibles which they use in fights with other males to gain access to females. There is considerable variation in the length of these mandibles, much of which is known to be associated with the diet of the males during development.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) have been suggested to be important in the regulation of weaponry in insects, and Okada and co-workers identified five ILP genes in the <em>G. cornutus</em> genome. To test whether they were involved in weapon growth, they silenced these genes using RNA interference (RNAi) in final instar larvae, and then measured the mandible size and also a number of other measures of size in the adult males. RNAi coding for green flourescent protein (GFP) was used as a control.</p>
<p>Here, we’re going to model the relationship between RNAi treatment and mandible length. Because mandible length increases with body size, we’ll also include elytron width in our model as a measure of body size. The dataframe is loaded as <code>gnatocerus</code>. Let’s start by checking its structure.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(gnatocerus)</code></pre>
<pre><code>&#39;data.frame&#39;:   144 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ treatment: chr  &quot;1ILP&quot; &quot;1ILP&quot; &quot;1ILP&quot; &quot;1ILP&quot; ...
 $ EW       : num  1480 1336 1560 1319 1323 ...
 $ ML       : num  261 235 287 239 139 ...</code></pre>
<p>There are three variables: <code>treatment</code> which is the RNAi treatment the beetle received, <code>EW</code> which is Elytra Width in µm and <code>ML</code> which is Mandible Length, also in µm. <code>ML</code> is our response variable and <code>EW</code> is a continuous explanatory variable. <code>treatment</code> has discrete values and we will be wanting to use this as a factor in our model. Before we do anything else, then, we need to ask R to make it into a factor using the <code>as.factor()</code> function. Check the conversion has gone correctly with the <code>summary()</code> function.</p>

<p><code>GFP</code> refers to the beetles given RNAi for Green Flourescent Protein (a jellyfish protein) as a control, and <code>1ILP</code> to <code>5ILP</code> are the five insulin-like protein genes which were suppressed using RNAi in the final instar larvae. Let’s draw a scatterplot of <code>ML</code> against <code>EW</code>, colour coded by the levels of <code>treatment</code> to get an idea of what our data look like.</p>
<p>Because we have lots of factor levels we’ll use a colour palette from the RColorBrewer package. This package gives R users access to the colour palettes from <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/">the color brewer website</a>. The package will be automatically installed if you are using a recent version of R, otherwise you might need to install it yourself using <code>install.packages("RColorBrewer")</code>. We can generate a palette with 6 colours like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RColorBrewer)

palette1 &lt;- brewer.pal(n = 6, name = &#39;Dark2&#39;)</code></pre>

<p><summary><strong>Click here for more on what to do with these data</strong></summary></p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, it’s always best to avoid removing data from an analysis for any reason. Nonetheless, we do sometimes get data points that just look like they shouldn’t be there, and sometimes they really shouldn’t: errors can be made during measurement and recording data, and other errors can be made such as misidentification of individuals, mistakes in care of experimental plants, animals or cultures or in the preparation of reagents and so on. Detecting and dealing with such anomalies is fraught with risk because because the potential for bias and unconsciously altering the results to fit a particular hypothesis is so high. In the mind of your author, the only time when it’s really justified is when there is obviously something anomalous about a data point which means that you can be sure that it should not be there. Impossible values such as negative values when the variable in question cannot be negative, or fractions when the data can only be integers, are clearly anomalous and an indicator that an error has been made in measuring or recording the value. When it comes data points with values that are just unlikely, however, things are much more difficult. In these cases it’s good practice to think about four questions.</p>
<p>Is the data point clearly so far outside the range that would be expected given the distribution of the rest of the data that in all probability an error has been made?</p>
<p>Based on your knowledge of the system, is the value of the data point one that is possible?</p>
<p>Is it possible that the experimental protocol might have caused this extreme value?</p>
<p>Is this single data point likely to have an disptoprtionate effect on the outcome of the analysis?</p>
<p>In this case, the individual with the mandible length of 921 µm has a mandible length that is very much higher than all of the rest. Furthermore, there’s no indication of positive skew in the remainder of the data which could lead to a few very high values.</p>
<p>Overall then, we’re probably justified in thinking there’s something fishy about this particular data point. What you would do now if you were running this project is to go back and check the lab notebooks and see what was written down when this experiment was done. With any luck you’ll find the correct value then. If you’re unable to correct the value then you can cautiously consider removing the data point, but only do this when all other avenues have been explored. <strong>If you do remove an outlier you MUST say so in your report.</strong> We’ll just analyse the data without the outlier here but the <strong>best practice is to present analysis results both with and without the outlier present</strong>.</p>
<p>To find out which row of the data frame corresponds to this data point we can use <code>which()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>which(gnatocerus$ML &gt;900)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] 24</code></pre>
<p>See if you can remove the outlier from these data, and allocate the edited data frame to a new object called <code>gnatocerus2</code>. Check it’s worked by calling <code>summary</code> on the new <code>ML</code> variable in <code>gnatocerus2</code> — the new maximum value should be more sensible.</p>

<p>The model we will fit will have two explanatory variables, <code>EW</code>, elytron width, included as a measure of overall beetle size, and <code>treatment</code> which tells us the experimental treatment the beetles received. It’s necessary to include a measure of body size because mandible length, our response variable, increases with body size, and because the experimental treatment we are using might well change the relationship between these two variables. Rather than just asking “does mandible length change with treatment?”, therefore, we really need to ask “does the relationship between mandible length and body size change with treatment?”.</p>
<p>Before we fit our model, however, we should think a little about how we can best ask the questions that we’re really interested in. As we discussed way back in the first tutorial on single factor ANOVA, what the coefficients table you get in R gives us is a set of <em>treatment contrasts</em> which allow us to make certain comparisons directly without using things like post-hoc tests. As you’ve hopefully gathered by now, the default for these contrasts is to make the first factor level in alphabetical order into the <em>reference level</em> which is used for the intercept and which the other levels are compared with. In the case of <code>treatment</code> the reference level is the first one listed by <code>levels()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>levels(gnatocerus2$treatment)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;1ILP&quot; &quot;2ILP&quot; &quot;3ILP&quot; &quot;4ILP&quot; &quot;5ILP&quot; &quot;GFP&quot; </code></pre>
<p><code>1ILP</code> is first because numbers come before letters in alphabetical order, so <code>1ILP</code> is the reference level. We don’t want to see contrasts between the <code>1ILP</code> factor level and the others, however. The animals given the GFP RNAi treatment are the controls, and the question we’re interested in is whether treatment with our candidate insulin-like peptides changes the mandible length - elytron width relationship is relative to the <code>GFP</code> treatment. To see the contrasts with <code>GFP</code> we can use the <code>relevel()</code> function to change the reference level. <code>relevel()</code> takes two arguments, the name of the factor and then <code>ref =</code> followed by the name of the new reference level, typically in quote marks. Don’t forget to allocate the new factor returned by <code>relevel()</code> to the <code>gnatocerus2$treatment</code> variable.</p>
<p>Once it’s done you can check the reference level by using <code>levels()</code> again.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve done something that 95% of biology academics don’t do before jumping straight into the stats, namely thinking about the reason why we’re doing the analysis and what the questions we’re trying to answer are, we can go ahead and fit our model. Main effects plus interaction please, and call the model <code>B1</code>. Check for significance using <code>drop1()</code>. To get the standard R formatted output please enclose your <code>drop1()</code>function call in <code>print()</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the coefficients table, the value for <code>EW</code> gives the slope for the fitted line relating elytron width to mandible length for the control <code>GFP</code> treatment. This is very close to 1 indicating that for the control beetles mandible length increases by 1µm for every 1µm increase in elytron width. The five lines at the end of the coefficients table labelled <code>EW:treatment1ILP</code> and so on give the estimated differences in slope between the line fitted for the <code>GFP</code> treatment and the lines fitted for the five ILP treatments.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>(Intercept)</code> row gives us the estimated value for the intercept of the line relating mandible length to elytron width for the controls, and the rows labelled <code>treatment1ILP</code> and so on give us the differences in intercept for each of the five levels of <code>treatment</code> that are not controls. Note that differences in intercept are almost inevitable when there are differences in slope: if the data are in approximately the same space, as the slope of a line decreases so its intercept is likely to increase.</p>
<p>Have a look at the values of the estimated coefficients and have a go at the questions.</p>

<p>What our model is telling us is that the 1ILP treatment has a strong effect on mandible growth, with the relationship between body size and mandible length being substantially reduced compared to controls. The 2ILP and 3ILP treatments also have some effect, with the slopes of the relationships between mandible length and body size being reduced by both treatments, but the magnitude of these effects and also our confidence in them is rather less than for 1ILP. 4ILP and 5ILP seem to have no real detectable effect on mandible growth.</p>

<h2>Visualising the model output using ggplot</h2>
<p>We could visualise the model output by just plotting the fitted lines onto a scatterplot using <code>abline()</code> or by using <code>predict()</code> to generate fitted values and confidence intervals. There is a much easier way, however, which is to use ggplot2. This graphics package is very good at pltting graphs with multiple factor levels visualised, and it would be silly not to at least show you how to do it in this case. We;re not going to go through it in detail because that would take a ot of explanation, but if you want to know more there are a lot of useful resources available on how to use ggplot2 - Winston Chang’s <a href="https://r-graphics.org/">R Graphics Cookbook</a> is very good in my opinion.</p>
<p>To visualise our data with lines fitted for each level of treatment using ggplot2 we can just use this code. We could have plotted the confidence intervals for each line in as well but with more than a few lines this just makes a mess.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)

p1 &lt;- ggplot(data = gnatocerus2) +  # tell iw which dtaa frame to use
  aes(x = EW, y = ML, colour = treatment) + # specify the &#39;aesthetics&#39;
  geom_point() + # add layer with points plotted
  geom_smooth(method= &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + # add lines
  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) + # use the Dark2 palette
  theme_bw() + # use a better theme than the nasty default one
  labs(x = &quot;Elytron width (µm)&quot;, y = &quot;Mandible length (µm)&quot;) # axis labels

p1</code></pre>
<p><img src="Linear_models_6-_factors_and_continuous_variables_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>Here you can see the very large effect that 1ILP has, wth all of the points well below the remainder. Looking at the lines for 2ILP and 3ILP you can see that they do have different slopes when compared to GFP but the elevation is roughly the same and so if these insulin-like proteins are having an effect it is quite subtle. The 4ILP and 5ILP lines are very close to the GFP line as we would expect from our model output.</p>
